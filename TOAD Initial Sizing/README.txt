TOAD INITIAL SIZING:

This is a collection of scripts attempting to generate parameters and geometries for the every upper level component (i.e. tanks, propellant, landing legs, mass, pressurant).

CONTRIBUTERS:
Adam Grendys, Stathis Kokkevis, Jacob Metcalf, Rugved Dikay, Pablo Plata, certainly more...

STATUS:
Flight Profile - done (3DOF in work for higher res)
Propellant Tanks - done
Pressurant - WIP (made, not integrated)
Feed System - WIP (loss function skeleton built)
Chamber Sizing - WIP (made, not integrated)
Structure - not started
Landing Legs - not started
